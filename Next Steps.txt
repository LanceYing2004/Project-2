1. Pulley and SnowBlowerBody not being drawn
3. GetX and GetY in Shape & Machine1Factory
2. Verify Sink functionality in Shape, Pulley & SnowBlowerBody (Program crashes when creating pulley 2)
GetSource(), nullptr
4. Rotation of Pulley and Snowblowerbody
5. Motor::Size in Motor.h, is it allowed?
6. void Pulley::Rotate(double rotation), missing 1 step. I believe it's related to the issue of the pulley
not turning together as well. i.e. Pulley3, Pulley4 and the flag is not turning.
For some reason, the mSink size = 0 when using the debugger.
7. The speed of different pulleys, should they be changed?
8. Number of flags on pulley 4
9. Draw snow
10. Oscillating snowblower
12. Yellow snow
11. Integration of Canadian Experience, 2 machines
13. Canadian exp. start time
create a bool header guard, so that the machine 1 will start to draw after like 10 seconds etc.

14. Machine Dialogue
Use the wxFormBuilder, create a dropdown menu that could change both machine numbers. For example, machine 1 changes
to machine 2, 3, 4 etc.
15. reverse time issue
16. Snowblower oscillating out of place
17. Delete snow
